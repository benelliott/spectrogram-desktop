
INTRODUCTION

The jfftw package is a Java interface to FFTW, a highly optimized FFT algorithm library.

NOTES

jfftw-1.2 was created for FFTW-2.1.3, using Sun's J2SDK-1.4.0.

The C header files were generated with the `javah' tool distributed with the Sun Java SDK.
They might be platform specific, but probably they aren't.

Documentation is included in the Java source files and can be extracted with the `javadoc'
tool distributed with the Sun Java SDK. (They are also included in a separate directory.)

COPYING

FFTW was created by MIT, jfftw was created by Daniel Darabos (cyhawk@sch.bme.hu).
Both have GPL licenses.
